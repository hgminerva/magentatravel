          <hr class="small">
          <p>"We had done quite a bit of research and investigated quite a few companies.  We were impresed immediately with Magenta Travel from our initial conversation.  The conversations were friendly and courteous and there was no pressure made for immediate commitments.  We had many questions for Pam prior to our signing and they were always answered promptly.  The procedure went well and Magenta Travel was helpful in tracking the progress and keeping us up to date.  Thank your very much for all of your hard work and outstanding assistance."</p>

          <br>
          <p>"When we started out on this 'journey' I was skeptical as a result of hearing of all the "scam" around regarding the Time share Vacations.  As time went on, however, I became more confident that I had made the right decision to go with Magenta Travel.  My representative as always prompt in replying to my concerns and questions and following through with Magenta Travel Services on my behalf.  Their status reports were very helpful in following the vacation plans.  And again, thanks for planning a memorable vacation."</p>

          <p>"My wife and I decided to finally try the Magenta Travel Vacation.  We have seen them at Ellenton Outlet Mall for several years.  We started with the Orlando Disney Vacation and had a ball.  The hotel where we stayed was 5 stars.  Even though we would spend all day at the parks, it was a good feeling to come home to luxry.  We have not done the cruise yet, but there have been no surprises.  Thanks again for a First Class Vacation."</p>

                      d) While Magenta Travel will make commercially reasonable efforts to assist those making or arranging reservations on behalf of the Customer in complying with the Customer’s travel policy, it is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that all those making or arranging reservations on its behalf comply with its travel policy.

                      7. Late Payments <br><br>
                      In the event that any sums due by the Customer to Magenta Travel are not paid when due then, without prejudice to any other remedies of Magenta Travel, Magenta Travel may at any time: <br><br>
                      a) Suspend all or part of the provision of the Arrangement Services to the Customer; and/or <br><br>
                      b) Charge interest on all overdue sums at a rate of 1.5% per month until paid; and/or <br><br>
                      c) Cancel (without any liability to the Customer or to any Passenger) any reservations for Travel Services made on behalf of the Customer in respect of which payment is outstanding, with any cancellation fees incurred as a result thereof being for the account of the Customer.<br><br>
                      8. Liability<br><br>
                      a) Subject to Clause 8(b), in the event of a claim by the Customer or by any Guest in respect of the supply of the Arrangement Services or any other liability whatsoever for which Magenta Travel is responsible in law, Magenta Travel's liability in any event shall not exceed the total amount paid or payable by the Customer to Magenta Travel by way of fees for the supply of the Arrangement Services concerned and the associated Travel Services. <br><br>
                      b) Magenta Travel shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Customer or any Guest in respect of any indirect, special, consequential, punitive or other damages (howsoever incurred). <br><br>
                      c) Magenta Travel shall not be liable to the Customer or any Guest for any default or failure in any supply by any Third Party Supplier or for any loss, claim, cost, damage or injury incurred by the Customer or any Guest (directly or indirectly) as a result of the acts or omissions of the Third Party Supplier.<br><br>
                      9. Insurance<br><br>
                      The Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is reasonable and prudent for the Customer (and/or any Guest) to put in place a policy of insurance in respect of any loss, claim, cost, damage or injury incurred in connection with the Travel Services or any travel resulting there from. Magenta Travel shall make commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Customer and/or the Passenger in obtaining such a policy of insurance from an insurer on the express request of the Customer and on payment of the appropriate premium. The Customer agrees to make each and every Guest aware of the provisions of this Clause 9.<br><br>
                      10. Waiver No delay or failure to take action under these Standard Terms and Conditions shall constitute any waiver by Magenta Travel of any provision of these Standard Terms and Conditions.<br><br> 
                      11. Variation Magenta Travel reserves the right to review and adjust all elements of fees without prior notice to take account of (but not limited to) inflation, increased charges, costs, or changes to terms and conditions by Third Party Suppliers or other parties that may impact on us.<br><br>
                      12. Jurisdiction and Governing Law These terms and conditions, any supply of the Arrangement Services to the Customer and/or the Guest and any contracts between Magenta Travel and the Customer shall be governed by the laws of Florida and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the state courts and federal district courts within the State of Florida, without prejudice to the right of Magenta Travel to seek recovery of any sums due from the Customer before any court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>
