          <hr class="small">
          <p>"We had done quite a bit of research and investigated quite a few companies.  We were impresed immediately with Magenta Travel from our initial conversation.  The conversations were friendly and courteous and there was no pressure made for immediate commitments.  We had many questions for Pam prior to our signing and they were always answered promptly.  The procedure went well and Magenta Travel was helpful in tracking the progress and keeping us up to date.  Thank your very much for all of your hard work and outstanding assistance."</p>

          <br>
          <p>"When we started out on this 'journey' I was skeptical as a result of hearing of all the "scam" around regarding the Time share Vacations.  As time went on, however, I became more confident that I had made the right decision to go with Magenta Travel.  My representative as always prompt in replying to my concerns and questions and following through with Magenta Travel Services on my behalf.  Their status reports were very helpful in following the vacation plans.  And again, thanks for planning a memorable vacation."</p>

          <p>"My wife and I decided to finally try the Magenta Travel Vacation.  We have seen them at Ellenton Outlet Mall for several years.  We started with the Orlando Disney Vacation and had a ball.  The hotel where we stayed was 5 stars.  Even though we would spend all day at the parks, it was a good feeling to come home to luxry.  We have not done the cruise yet, but there have been no surprises.  Thanks again for a First Class Vacation."</p>
